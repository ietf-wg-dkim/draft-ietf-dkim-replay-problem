# Building the Draft

This markdown document is converted into an RFC using the following tools:

- mmark

- xml2rfc

## mmark

mmark can be found https://github.com/mmarkdown/mmark. There are prebuilt
binaries for most platforms.

Details on mmark - syntax, examples, etc can be found https://mmark.miek.nl/

### xml2rfc

xml2rfc is part of the ietf-tools https://github.com/ietf-tools.
It is python and can be found on pypi, etc.
My Suggestion is to use python virtual environments if you are familiar with
them.

### author-tools.ietf.org

Alternatively, https://author-tools.ietf.org/ allows one to upload drafts
in multiple formats and get back xml2rfc.

Other tools which I've found useful are rfcdiff, idnits, etc.
These are in the ietf-tools repository

I am glad to offer assistance if one has questions, etc
